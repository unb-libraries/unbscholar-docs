#Draft Workflow for Islandora Ingest of Senior Reports

This document is intended for use within the Science and Engineering Libraries at the University of New Brunswick for the purpose of populating the UNB Scholar Research Repository and the Islandora CMS/Repository software package. If there are any questions or recommendations regarding this document, please contact [Mike Nason](mailto:michael.nason@gmail.com) for clarification and/or assistance. 

This document is likely to change as feedback arrives and as changes are made to either collections or Islandora itself. 

**Step 1) Navigate to the Relevant Collection for Uploaded Material**

The **browse** button in the top navigation bar will take you to the current UNB Scholar collection. Currently, these are arranged by faculty names and a common collection structure below that. For example, clicking on "Faculty of Computer Science" will present the following sub-collections:

- Faculty Publications
- Graduate Publications
- Undergraduate Publications
	- Senior Reports

Click on through to the Senior Reports collection. 

**Step 2) "Manage" the Collection to Begin Uploading Process**

To add content to this collection, while logged in and within that collection, click on the "Manage" button that appears over the content within the collection. From the management pages, we can edit content, add policies, change access... there are many functions.

For right now, we're only concerned about adding content. Click the link that says "add an object to this collection".

**Step 3) Choosing the Type of Content Model**

When you add content to Islandora, it will prompt the user to select which type of content they would like to add in a dropdown menu. The types of content can be changed at the collection level, but they should be pre-set. The two default types of content for Senior Report collections are "citation content model" and "thesis content model"
