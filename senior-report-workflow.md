#Draft Workflow for Islandora Ingest of Senior Reports

This document is intended for use within the Science and Engineering Libraries at the University of New Brunswick for the purpose of populating the [UNB Scholar Research Repository](http://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca) and the Islandora CMS/Repository software package. If there are any questions or recommendations regarding this document, please contact [Mike Nason](mailto:michael.nason@gmail.com) for clarification and/or assistance. 

This document is likely to change as feedback arrives and as changes are made to either collections or Islandora itself. Additionally, a [best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iAgjIYpuX7PVbTdfZCt7ipWEFvM5R_aQdrY6pB-y-A/edit?usp=sharing) google doc has been created to be developed as we go. 

**Step 1) Navigate to the Relevant Collection for Uploaded Material**

The **browse** button in the top navigation bar will take you to the current UNB Scholar collection. Currently, these are arranged alphabetically by faculty names and a common collection structure below that. For example, clicking on "Faculty of Computer Science" will present the following sub-collections:

- Faculty Publications
- Graduate Publications
- Undergraduate Publications
	- Senior Reports

Click on through to the Senior Reports collection. 

**Step 2) "Manage" the Collection to Begin Uploading Process**

To add content to this collection, **while logged in** and within that collection, click on the "**Manage**" button that appears over the content within the collection. From the management pages, we can edit content, add policies, change access... all of the management of content in Islandora happens from here.

For right now, we're only concerned about adding content. Click the link that says "add an object to this collection".

**Step 3) Choosing the Type of Content Model**
<<<<<<< HEAD

When you add content to Islandora, it will prompt the user to select which type of content they would like to add in a dropdown menu. The types of content can be changed at the collection level, but they should be pre-set. The two default types of content for Senior Report collections are "citation content model" and "thesis content model" 

Select **Citation Content Model** from the dropdown menu.

**Step 4) Metadata Entry**

After selecting the content model, you'll be left with the blank fields for entering metadata related to the object at hand. As this is the first real attempt at group metadata entry in our instance of Islandora, we don't have a formalized [*Best Practices* document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iAgjIYpuX7PVbTdfZCt7ipWEFvM5R_aQdrY6pB-y-A/edit?usp=sharing). Here are things to keep in mind, however: 

- more metadata is better; put in as much as you can
- don't make up any metadata you are unsure of
- make notes of curious fields, we can sort out [best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iAgjIYpuX7PVbTdfZCt7ipWEFvM5R_aQdrY6pB-y-A/edit?usp=sharing) as we go

*A note on Faculty/Departments*

Islandora treats Departments and Faculties as “entities”. This means there should be a consistent name for them. While the content we’re working on is historical, it’s worth noting that department of faculty names may have changed over time. For example, the *Department of Forestry and Environmental Management* was formerly known as the *Department of Forestry*. 

For the purpose of browsing and faceting, it’s important to **populate these fields with the current name of a department or faculty** and note the historic name in the **notes field**. 

![image5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/master/images/seniorrep05.png)

Any current Faculty or Department should have an entity before your project starts and Islandora should autocomplete the metadata when you start to type the name of the department to help ensure the correct selection.

It is worth noting that Islandora allows for historic names to be part of the metadata for the departmental/faculty entity itself. In this case, though the entry in the article may be redundant, it also couldn’t hurt. 

**Step 5) Copyright and "Publication"**
