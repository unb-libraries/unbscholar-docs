# Uploads Guide for Technical Report Series

> Hi there! If you're reading this document it's because we've asked you to help with the definitely-life-affirming process of ingesting materials into our "institutional repository", _UNB Scholar_ (scholar for short). This is a step-by-step guide to ingesting with a very specific set of content. I'm so sorry. But, you'll be great! Don't even worry. Don't even trip.

## What's Being Uploaded?

You'll be uploading a series of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering documents. These are they:

- technical reports
- class notes
- publications and conference proceedings

There are about 200 things to upload. That's really not too many. The time will fly by. Later, you'll find yourself reminiscing on the time you spent doing this with something like fondness; something at least adjacent to fondness.

## Step 0 // Setup

You'll have to make sure you have access to everything you need or you'll probably not be very productive. I'd recommend being productive, where possible.

1. The first thing you need is the content you're uploading. If you don't have access to the things, talk to Rob or Mike to get access to the things.
2. You're going to need access and permissions to the Institutional Repository. This is super easy.
    1. Go to https://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca
    2. Scroll to the very bottom of the page.
    3. Click, login.
    4. Login with your usual credentials.
    5. Let Mike know that you've logged in, so that he can grant you permissions to add content. That might be a few minutes. Take this time to:
        - get a coffee
        - perform some sort of affirmation to yourself. let yourself know that you're a good person and you deserve good things.
        - shoot the breeze
    6. Make sure your login works once you have it.

## Step 1 // Get the things

Open the folder with the shared content and

## Step 2 // Login to Scholar

You're going to be uploading these to scholar, which is at:  

> http://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca

Here's how you login:

![login process](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads1.gif?raw=true)

After you're logged in, navigate to main directory like so:

![islandora directory](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads2.gif?raw=true)

## Step 3 // Go to where the things are going

There are three types of content and they'll have three homes, go to the directory you need:

![navigate to collection](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads3.gif?raw=true)

If you need to go back, click the breadcrumb:

![back breadcrumb](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads4.gif?raw=true)

## Step 4 // Start Ingest

Once you're in the right directory, you can start to add content.

1. Click the **Manage** tab.
2. Click "Add an object to this collection".
3. Select **Article** (unless it isn't an article, then click the thing it is).
4. Get to fillin'.

![add an object](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads5.gif?raw=true)

## Step 5 // Metadatin'

Fill out the metadata to the very best of your ability. Please make sure you fill out as much of it as you have starting from "submission type" at the top all the way down. If something in the form doesn't exist, don't worry! It's ok to have empty fields. You just want to make sure that you've filled in everything you can.

Conversely, if there's a drop-down menu that is missing what the type of content you're trying to upload, don't force it! Hold off on that article and let Mike know the content you want to add is missing from the form. Here's an example:

![missing item](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads6.gif?raw=true)

In this situation, we have an entry for **Technical Report** but we _definitely don't_ have an entry for **Lecture Note**. Don't, like, go upload a lecture note if it's missing from this list. Don't fudge it. Just let Mike know something is missing and he'll add it. This applies for basically any drop-down in the form if something doesn't show up.

**_This is extra super extra the case if you click a drop-down item and there's nothing in it. This means the system needs to be rebooted and I'd super appreciate it if you'd let Rob or Mike know about it and just totally stop uploading anything until it's fixed, please and thank you so much you're the best keep it up._** That particular problem looks like [this](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/images/uploads7.png?raw=true). It will probably happen a lot.

## Step 6 // Uploadin'

At the bottom of the metadata form you'll see a next button. Please do click it when you're done your metadata. It'll then ask you if you want to upload a PDF. You do.

1. Click the box asking if you want to upload a PDF.
2. Find the file you want to upload.
3. Click "upload".
4. Fill out the information before. For almost everything you're uploading, it'll be "published" and "contact publisher" and "I have the right". Exceptions are:
    - Lecture Notes would be listed as "other" and "contact author".
    - Conference Proceedings would be listed as "other" and "contact author"
5. Click the upload button at the bottom.

## Step 7 // Editing

In the event that you make a mistake (we all make mistakes unless we're lying to ourselves) you'll want to go back and edit a record. It's pretty easy.

1. From the record you want to edit, click the **Manage** tab.
2. Click **Datastreams** from the sub-menu.
3. Look for the line that says the word "MODS" and follow along that line to the "edit" link.
4. Select the type of form you want to edit, it'll be whatever you originally recorded.
5. Get to Editing.

# Thanks for Playing

If you have questions about any of this just as Mike or Rob. They can help. They will help. They are helpers. I'm so sorry. It'll be ok.
