#Reporting an Issue with Islandora

If you have any problems or run into anything particularly weird with Islandora and UNB Scholar, you have two options. 

1. [Email the UNB Scholar Administrator](mailto:michael.nason@gmail.com). 
2. [Contact systems for support](mailto:libsystems@unb.ca).

##How You Can Help us Help You

One thing that is really tough is determining the source of a problem in a system as complex as Islandora. When you contact either the administrator or systems, here are some things you can do to make sure we can help. 

1. Describe what you were doing when you had the issue with enough detail that we can repeat your steps. 
2. Tell us what time the error occurred. 
3. Tell us the URL you were on when the error occurred. 
4. Send us a *full screenshot* of what's on your monitor at the moment of the error.

Hopefully, with enough detail, we can track down and fix the error you're contacting us about. Thanks!
