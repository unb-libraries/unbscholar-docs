UNB Scholar Documentation
===============

Michael Nason // December, 2014

This repository is for the storage and dissemination of documentation for UNB Scholar production and workflows at the University of New Brunswick Centre for Digital Scholarship. 

Content is also available at the Systems Wiki, but only for those on UNB's campus. Some docs may be found there that are not found here. If you have any issues with Islandora itself or see any bizarre errors please review the [support documentation](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs/blob/master/support.md) and contact us with as much detail as possible.
